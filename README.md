# RobotCalculatorApp

I created this desktop application with tkinter framework to calculate the number of mobile robots needed to accommodate the current demands.

To use this application, you need to know:
1. From where
2. To where
3. Production Rate (piece/hour)
4. Distance (ft)

After you input all the information, press "Calculate", the application will give you the result
